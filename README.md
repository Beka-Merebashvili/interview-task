- Access the application using predefined user credentials obtained from the Reqres.in test API.
- Use the following credentials:
  - Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
  - Password: cityslicka

# User Table Display

- Upon successful login, the application fetches user information from the Reqres.in API and displays it in a table format.
- User information includes details such as ID, email, first name, and last name.

# Local Storage Handling

- User information retrieved from the API is saved to the local storage to maintain session data.
- Upon logout, the stored user information is deleted from the local storage.

# Logout Functionality

- Allows the user to log out from the application.
- Clicking the logout button removes the user session, clears stored information, and redirects the user to the login screen.
